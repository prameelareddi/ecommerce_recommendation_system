## Content based Product Recommendation System  
This project implements a recommendation engine for fashion products using image embeddings generated by a ResNet50 model. The process involves extracting features from product images, creating embeddings, and then using them for real-time recommendations through a Streamlit app.


Dataset:
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small)

**How to Use:**

**Step 1:** Clone the Repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/innData-Analytics/ecommerce_recommendation_engine.git
  ```
  ```bash
  cd ecommerce_recommendation_engine
  ```
**Step 2:** Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3:** Generate Image Embeddings  
Run the following command to extract features from the product images and generate embeddings:

```bash
python model_embeddings.py
```

**Step 4:** Run the Streamlit App  
Execute the following command to launch the Streamlit app for real-time product recommendations:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## How the Project Works:

### Image Embedding Generation:

- The `model_embeddings.py` script uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from fashion product images.
- The features are then normalized and saved along with corresponding filenames using pickle.

### Streamlit App for Recommendations:

- The `app.py` script sets up a Streamlit app that allows users to upload an image of a product.
- The uploaded image is processed to extract features using the same ResNet50 model.
- The Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to find similar products based on the extracted features.
- The app displays the uploaded image and recommends similar products in a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure:

- **model_embeddings.py:** Contains code for feature extraction, normalization, and saving embeddings.
- **app.py:** Defines the Streamlit app, handles file uploads, image processing, and recommendation display.
- **sample/:** Folder containing sample images for testing.
- **uploads/:** Folder to store temporarily uploaded images.
- **images/:** Folder for storing  product images (please download the dataset).
- **testing.py:** Used for testing the code locally.
- **rough.py:** Contains rough code to clean the dataset.
- **requirements.txt:** Includes dependencies needed for the project. 


This project provides a foundation for building a  product recommendation system, allowing users to experience real-time recommendations based on their uploaded product images.

## Collaborative Product Recommendation System 
This project implements a simple product search and recommendation system using FastAPI. It allows users to search for products and provides related products based on cosine similarity.

## Features

- **Search API:** `/search?query=your_product_name` - Provides search results, related products, and past user searches.

- **Past Searches API:** `/past_searches` - Displays a list of past user searches.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- pandas
- nltk
- scikit-learn

data.csv: Dataset file containing product information. Modify or replace it with your dataset.

## Usage

1. Run the FastAPI application:

    ```bash
    uvicorn Api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```

2. Access the API endpoints:

    - Search API: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?query=your_product_name](http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?query=your_product_name)
    - Past Searches API: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/past_searches](http://127.0.0.1:8000/past_searches)
